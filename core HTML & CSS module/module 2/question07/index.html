    <h1>5 programming quotes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>“when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only
            narrow & exclude people. so create.”</li>
        <li>
            “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”
        </li>
        <li>
            “Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where
            you live”
        </li>
        <li>
            “Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof
            programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.”
        </li>
        <li>
            “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can
            understand.”
        </li>
    </ul>
